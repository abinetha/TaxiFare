## Overview

TaxiFare Prediction is a machine learning project aimed at predicting taxi fares based on various features such as pickup and dropoff coordinates, as well as the haversine distance between the pickup and dropoff 

points. The project utilizes regression techniques to estimate the fare amount for a given taxi ride.

## Features

**Haversine Distance:** The distance between two points on the Earth's surface calculated using the haversine formula. It serves as a crucial feature for fare estimation, as it directly correlates with the distance traveled.

**Pickup Coordinates:** Latitude and longitude coordinates of the pickup location.

**Dropoff Coordinates:** Latitude and longitude coordinates of the dropoff location.

## Data

The project utilizes a dataset containing historical taxi ride information. Each data point includes the following features:

**Pickup Latitude**

**Pickup Longitude**

**Dropoff Latitude**

**Dropoff Longitude**

**Haversine Distance**

**Fare Amount**

**The dataset is used to train and evaluate machine learning models for fare prediction.**

## Installation

**Clone the repository:**

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TaxiFarePrediction.git
```

**Install dependencies:**

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

**Data Preprocessing:** Preprocess the raw data to extract relevant features such as haversine distance and normalize the data if necessary.

**Model Training:** Train machine learning models such as linear regression, random forest regression, or gradient boosting regression using the preprocessed data.

**Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained models using performance metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, or R-squared score.

**Prediction:** Utilize the trained model to predict taxi fares for new ride instances.

## Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by the need to accurately estimate taxi fares based on ride attributes.

Thanks to the open-source community for providing valuable libraries and resources for machine learning and data analysis.
